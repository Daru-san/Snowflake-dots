# SnowflakeOS
My flake-based NixOS configuration featuring Hyprland, Sway and many more

## Status
* Right now this repo is still in it's early development phase so don't expect much of it.
* The first stable merge will be pushed when I can get the configuration working on the 'testing' branch


## TODO:

### To be done:
- [ ] Merge branch dev with this branch

### In Progress:
- [ ] Build the configuration

### Completed
- [x] Update flake
